                    Identification and management of risks relating to new and existing technologies, and services and products. Before offering new financial services or products or new or non-traditional sales channels to clients, or introducing new or emerging technologies, the board of SVS Wallet assesses the associated risks of money laundering and terrorist financing in cooperation with the contact person. The risks associated with new and existing technologies include the anonymity of customers and the risk of fraud using the identity of another person.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the risk assessment, both actual and potential risks are assessed and, if necessary, additional information is collected about risks and their mitigation measures.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After assessing the risks and their effects, SVS Wallet evaluates the most appropriate countermeasures to mitigate specific risks to the appropriate level for SVS Wallet and arranges the implementation of countermeasures, if necessary. The risks associated with anonymity and fraud are avoided by identifying persons by requiring the person concerned to provide a copy of an identity document and confirm its authenticity. In addition, the person is asked to provide copies of utility bills showing the address of their place of residence as well as the connection of this address to this specific person. If the person does not prove the aforementioned facts or SVS Wallet has doubts about the authenticity of the submitted documents, no service will be provided to the person.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    SVS Wallet assesses whether, by applying countermeasures, it is possible to bring the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with new financial services or products, new or non-traditional sales channels, or new or developing technologies to such a level that they correspond to the risk appetite of SVS Wallet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    New financial service or product, or new or non-traditional sales channels may be offered to clients or new or developing technologies introduced only if the accompanying money laundering and terrorist financing risks are in line with the risk appetite of SVS Wallet or can be brought to an acceptable level by implementing countermeasures. At the same time, it is forbidden to conclude a contract or make a decision about opening an anonymous account.

                    In a situation where the client or its beneficial owner is a politically exposed person,
                     a family member or a known close associate of a politically exposed person, SVS Wallet applies the following due diligence:

                  <li>
                    If a politically exposed person no longer fulfills the prominent public functions assigned to them, SVS Wallet must take into account the risks that continue to be associated with the person in question and implement appropriate and risk-sensitive measures for at least 12 months until it is certain that the risks inherent to politically exposed person no longer apply to the relevant person.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    SVS Wallet may decide to not apply the due diligence provided for in this section to a politically exposed person, their family client or a person considered to be their close associate, if there are no other circumstances indicating a higher than normal risk.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    SVS Wallet must establish internal procedures to determine whether a potential client or a client’s actual beneficiary is a politically exposed person of another European Economic Area country or a third country, domestic politically exposed person or a person who performs or has performed prominent functions in international organizations. SVS Wallet must identify close associates and family clients of politically exposed persons only if their connection to the person performing prominent public functions is known to the public or if SVS Wallet has reason to believe that such a connection exists.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the case of politically exposed persons, in addition to the appropriate due diligence, SVS Wallet must implement, among others, the following measures:

                  <li>
                    The establishment of a business relationship with a politically exposed person must be decided by the management board, responsible board member or contact person of SVS Wallet.

                  <li>SVS Wallet is obliged to notify the Financial Intelligence Unit of (i) activities or (ii) circumstances identified in the course of economic activity:
                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-6 text-l text-gray-300">
                      <li>which have characteristics that indicate the use of proceeds from criminal activity or the commission of related criminal offenses (primarily related to reporting of suspicious and unusual transactions or activities);</li>
                      <li>which give rise to suspicion or which are known to be money laundering or the commission of related crimes, or the characteristics of which point to money laundering or the commission of related crimes (primarily related to reporting a suspected money laundering transaction or activity);</li>
                      <li>which give rise to suspicion or which are known to be terrorist financing or the commission of related crimes, or the characteristics of which point to terrorist financing or the commission of related crimes (primarily related to reporting a suspected terrorist financing transaction or activity);</li>
                      <li>in the event of which there is an attempt of the actions or circumstances specified in clauses 10.1.1 to 10.1.3;</li>
                      <li>in the event of which there is a suspicion or knowledge of the need to apply an international financial sanction (see chapter 11).</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>10.2. The Financial Intelligence Unit must also be notified of the following:
                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-6 text-l text-gray-300">
                      <li>the circumstances of refusing to establish a business relationship or an occasional transaction, if the basis for the refusal is suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, or if SVS Wallet is unable to apply the due diligence that must be applied when establishing a business relationship, because the client does not or refuses to provide the relevant data, or the data provided is not sufficient to ensure the adequacy of collected data;</li>
                      <li>the extraordinary termination of the business relationship, if the business relationship is terminated because it is not possible to apply the due diligence again as after a reasonable period of time SVS Wallet has still not been able to apply sufficient due diligence to exhaustively collect data, verify the accuracy of data or eliminate money laundering or terrorist financing suspicion, or because the client does not provide or refuses to provide the relevant data, or the data provided is not sufficient to ensure the adequacy of collected data (primarily reporting a suspicious and unusual transaction or activity).</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>The notifications specified in clauses 10.1 and 10.2 must be made before making a transaction, which gives rise to suspicion or which is known to be money laundering or terrorist financing or the commission of related crimes and if such circumstances are detected before making the transaction. Given the speed with which money laundering and terrorist financing crimes are committed, fulfilling this pre-transaction notification obligation may be appropriate in other cases as well. If postponing the transaction may cause significant damage, not making the transaction is not possible, or may prevent the capture of a potential perpetrator of money laundering or terrorist financing, the transaction is executed and then a report is submitted to the Financial Intelligence Unit. In order to identify such circumstances, the obliged person is in contact with the Financial Intelligence Unit.</li>
                  <li>In any event (i.e. also in a situation where an activity or a circumstance is detected after the transaction has been made), the reporting obligation must be fulfilled immediately but no later than two working days after the detection of such an activity or circumstance, or when a real suspicion arises (i.e. a situation where the suspicion cannot be refuted). The purpose of immediate notification is to give the Financial Intelligence Unit the opportunity to raise its own suspicions and apply its own measures, given that money laundering is a process where assets obtained as a result of criminal activity, especially financial assets, can often be transferred through the credit and financial institutions of several countries within one working day, therefore prompt notification helps track down so-called dirty money more effectively.</li>
                  <li>In addition to the situation mentioned in clause 10.3, SVS Wallet must also wait for the feedback of the Financial Intelligence Unit in other relevant cases before refusing to establish a business relationship or terminating the business relationship in an emergency.</li>
                  <li>If a so-called amount-based notification or a notification resulting from the establishment or extraordinary termination of a business relationship is being made and when the obliged person has identified the existence of activities or circumstances specified in clause 10.1 in regards to the client or circumstances connected to such a client, the notification obligation must also be fulfilled in the sense of clause 10.1, whereas this may also take place within the same notification process but by making reference to different indicators.</li>
                  <li>If the basis for fulfilling the reporting obligation is not the suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing but a so-called suspicious or unusual transaction and there are several such suspicious and unusual transactions and the reports made on the basis thereof are numerous or they are continuous (and such reporting does not require an emergency meeting with the Financial Intelligence Unit), the obliged person must have a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, after which, in addition to the relevant notification, due diligence must also be applied in other respects and a decision to refuse the transaction must be made.</li>
                  <li>If SVS Wallet detects a risky transaction in the course of making transactions, or if the person making the transaction does not submit an identity document, or when there is a doubt about the accuracy or authenticity of documents submitted, or if there is any other violation of the obligation of the person making the transaction, the circumstances related to the transaction shall be considered suspicious and the transaction is treated with extreme caution.</li>
                  <li>If an employee of SVS Wallet detects activities or circumstances in the course of economic or professional activities or operations the characteristics of which indicate money laundering or terrorist financing, or in regards to which they suspect or know that money laundering or terrorist financing is involved, they immediately inform the contact person of the company, who forwards the information to the Financial Intelligence Unit.</li>
                  <li>SVS Wallet, its structural unit, a member of a directing body and its employee is prohibited to notify a person, the beneficial owner or representative of the person about a notification given to the Financial Intelligence Unit, about the plan to submit such notification or the occurrence of such notification and about the precepts made by the Financial Intelligence Unit or initiation of criminal proceedings. SVS Wallet may notify the person of the disposal of the account assigned to him by the Financial Intelligence Unit or other restriction after the fulfillment of the precept made by the Financial Intelligence Unit. The prohibition set forth in this clause shall not be applied in the cases provided for in subsections 51(2) and 51(3) of the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act.</li>
                  <li>Indicators of suspicious transactions are given in the guidelines on the characteristics of suspicious transactions on the website of the Financial Intelligence Unit at <a href="https://SVS-igo.org" target="_blank">https://SVS-igo.org</a>. Compliance with this document is obligatory.</li>
                  <li>The law obliges to report cash transactions over 32,000 euros or an equivalent amount in another currency, regardless of whether the transaction is made as a single payment or as several related payments.</li>
                  <li>To the completed notification form, the contact person adds copies of the documents underlying the transaction, as well as copies of the documents underlying the identification of the person. Copies of other documents characterising the nature of the transaction may also be attached to the notification. The notification form to be submitted to the Financial Intelligence Unit and its completion instructions are located at <a href="https://fiu.ee/media/78/download" target="_blank">https://fiu.ee/media/78/download</a>.</li>
